# Linux Command Line Basics

In this session, we’ll dive into the fundamentals of the Linux command line interface (CLI). The command line is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with your Linux system efficiently. By the end of this session, you’ll be comfortable navigating the file system, running basic commands, and understanding how to use the CLI effectively.

## Theory

### What is the Command Line?
The command line is a text-based interface where you can type commands to perform tasks on your Linux system. It’s faster and more powerful than graphical interfaces for many tasks, especially in server environments.

### Key Concepts
- **Shell**: The program that interprets your commands (e.g., Bash, Zsh).
- **Terminal**: The application that provides access to the shell.
- **Commands**: Instructions you type to perform specific tasks.

### Basic Commands
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `ls`: List files and directories.
- `cd`: Change directory.
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
- `rm`: Remove files or directories.
- `cp`: Copy files or directories.
- `mv`: Move or rename files or directories.
- `touch`: Create an empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file.
