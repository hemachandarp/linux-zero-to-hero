## Session 1: Introduction to Linux

### Theory
#### What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Unix architecture. Itâ€™s widely used in servers, cloud environments, embedded systems, and even desktop computers. Unlike proprietary systems like Windows or macOS, Linux is free to use, modify, and distribute, making it a favorite among developers, sysadmins, and tech enthusiasts.

#### Why Learn Linux?
- **Ubiquity**: Linux powers 90% of the cloud infrastructure and most supercomputers.
- **Career Opportunities**: Linux skills are in high demand for DevOps, cloud engineering, and system administration roles.
- **Flexibility**: Linux is highly customizable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs.

#### Linux Distributions
Linux comes in many flavors, called distributions (or distros). Each distro is tailored for specific use cases:
- **Ubuntu**: Beginner-friendly, great for desktops and servers.
- **CentOS/RHEL**: Enterprise-grade, used in production environments.
- **Debian**: Stable and reliable, often used for servers.
- **Fedora**: Cutting-edge, ideal for developers.
