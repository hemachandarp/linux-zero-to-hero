# Session 2: Linux Command Line Basics

## Theory

### The Linux File System

Linux organizes files in a hierarchical directory structure. Here are some key directories:

- **/**: The root directory.  
- **/home**: Contains user directories.  
- **/etc**: Configuration files.  
- **/var**: Variable data like logs and databases.  
- **/bin** and **/usr/bin**: Executable programs.

### Basic Commands

- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.  
- `ls`: List files and directories.  
- `cd`: Change directory.  
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory.  
- `rm`: Remove files or directories.  
- `cp`: Copy files or directories.  
- `mv`: Move or rename files or directories.
