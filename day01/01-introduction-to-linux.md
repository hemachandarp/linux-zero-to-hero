## Session 1: Introduction to Linux

#### What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Unix architecture. Itâ€™s widely used in servers, cloud environments, embedded systems, and even desktop computers. Unlike proprietary systems like Windows or macOS, Linux is free to use, modify, and distribute, making it a favorite among developers, sysadmins, and tech enthusiasts.

#### Why Learn Linux?
- **Ubiquity**: Linux powers 90% of the cloud infrastructure and most supercomputers.
- **Career Opportunities**: Linux skills are in high demand for DevOps, cloud engineering, and system administration roles.
- **Flexibility**: Linux is highly customizable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs.

#### Linux Distributions
Linux comes in many flavors, called distributions (or distros). Each distro is tailored for specific use cases:
- **Ubuntu**: Beginner-friendly, great for desktops and servers.
- **CentOS/RHEL**: Enterprise-grade, used in production environments.
- **Debian**: Stable and reliable, often used for servers.
- **Fedora**: Cutting-edge, ideal for developers.

## Set up a Linux environment to practice your skills.

#### Steps
1. **Choose a Linux Distribution**:
   - For beginners, I recommend **Ubuntu** or **Linux Mint**.
2. **Set Up a Virtual Machine**:
   - Install VirtualBox or VMware on your computer.
   - Download the ISO file for your chosen Linux distro.
   - Create a new virtual machine and install Linux.
3. **Cloud-Based Option**:
   - Use a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to spin up a Linux instance.
   - Alternatively, use free services like [replit.com](https://replit.com) for a browser-based Linux terminal.

#### Verify Your Setup
- Open the terminal and run:
  ```bash
  uname -a
  ```
This command displays your Linux kernel version and system information.
