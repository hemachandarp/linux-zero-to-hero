## Best Practices and Common Issues

### Best Practices
- **Use Tab Completion**: Save time by pressing Tab to auto-complete file names and commands.
- **Keep Your System Updated**: Regularly update your Linux system to patch security vulnerabilities.
- **Backup Important Files**: Always keep backups of critical data.

### Common Issues
- **Running Commands as Root**: Avoid using `sudo` unless necessary. Misusing root privileges can break your system.
- **Deleting Files Carelessly**: Double-check before using `rm -rf`. Thereâ€™s no recycle bin in the terminal!
- **Ignoring Error Messages**: Always read error messages carefully. They often contain clues to fix the issue.
